## Getting Started

This repository leverages [VSCode's devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) feature to ensure all necessary dependencies are available inside the container for development.

### Application

To get started:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

This will start the application on your local machine, running on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173).

### Deployments

All application deployments are managed via GitHub Actions and the [`./.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow.

Additionally, application dependencies are automatically managed and updated via Dependabot and the [`./.github/workflows/automerge-dependabot.yml`](./.github/workflows/automerge-dependabot.yml) workflow.
